# Giphy
Use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of choice
The website has full mobile responsiveness.

When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.

Above every gif, its rating is displayed (PG, G, so on).

The form on the page takes the value from a user input box and adds it into the array of NBA legends.
